  blurb: "Deformable objects are challenging from both a perceptual and dynamic perspective:
   a crumpled cloth has many self-occlusions and its configuration is hard to infer from observations; 
   further, the dynamics of a cloth are complex to model and incorporate into planning algorithms.  
   We develop algorithms to handle deformable object manipulation tasks, such as cloth, liquids, dough, 
   and articulated objects."

- title: 3D Affordance Reasoning for Object Manipulation
  blurb: "In order for a robot to interact with an object, the robot must infer its “affordances”: 
  how the object moves as the robot interacts with it and how the object can interact with other objects 
  in the environment. We develop robot perception algorithms that learn to estimate these affordances and 
  then use such inferences to learn to manipulate objects to achieve a task."

- title: Multimodal Learning
  blurb: "Robots should use all of the sensors available to them, such as depth, RGB, and tactile data.  
  We have developed methods to intelligently integrate these sensor modalities."

- title: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
  blurb: "Robots can use data, either from the real world or from a simulator, to learn how to perform a task.  
  This is especially important for tasks which are difficult for robots to achieve via traditional techniques 
  such as motion planning, such as deformable object manipulation.  We have developed novel reinforcement 
  learning algorithms to more effectively learn from data."

- title: Autonomous Driving
  blurb: "In the domain of autonomous driving, we have developed novel methods for every part of the perception 
  pipeline: segmentation, object detection, tracking, and velocity estimation."

- title: Active Perception
  blurb: "Rather than statically observing a scene, robots can take actions to enable them to better perceive 
  a scene, known as “active perception.”"

- title: Self-Supervised Learning for Robotics
  blurb: "Rather than relying on hand-annotated data, self-supervised learning can enable robots to learn from 
  large unlabeled datasets."
